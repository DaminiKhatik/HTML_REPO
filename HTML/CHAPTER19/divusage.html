<div class="Div">
  <h2>Basic usage</h2>
  <p>The div element usually has no specific semantic meaning by itself, simply representing a division, and is typically
    used for grouping and encapsulating other elements within an HTML document and separating those from other
    groups of content. As such, each div is best described by its contents.</p>
